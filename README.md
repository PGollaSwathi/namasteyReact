- react Hooks - they are normal js functions , this are written by facebook developers

there are two very important hooks
-useState() -superpowerful state varibles
-useState used to create state variables , why we called state means because that is maintaing state of the component . UI keeps links with data layer

--for normal UI we cant update

-- when ever a state variable updates react re renders the componenets

React uses reconciliation alogorithum (react fiber):-
on the UI we hav e DOM :-
res-conatainer cantains 15 restro cards = UI changes 7 cards in to 3 filtered cards
-useEffect()
-if you want exit anything after rendering the componenet you have to write code in useEffect()

--shimmer UI - if you load any web page it will display dummy cards.

//when ever state variables update , react triggers a reconcilation cycle(re-render the components)
